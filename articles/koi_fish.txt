Breeding and Origin
Niigata excels for Koi breeding due to its superior clay, water quality, and natural surroundings.
Kohaku Koi are developed through careful selective crossing.
Asagi Koi evolved from black carp via natural genetic changes in rivers and ponds.
Only 200 breeders in Okiya produce high-quality, unique Koi after surviving intense competition.
Tancho Koi are selected from regular Kohaku or Taisho Sanshoku breedings, not specialized efforts.
Goshiki Koi originated from crossing Kohaku with Asagi, though they don't always show five colors today.
Ogon Koi were bred from black carp over generations without tropical fish influence.
Hi Bekko is a red Koi with black Sumi spots, descending from Taisho Sanshoku.
Identification and Characteristics
Nishikigoi, Japan's national fish, is known as "Kokugyo."
Hajiro is a black Koi with white fin tips, while Aka Hajiro is red with white fin tips.
Benigoi features a more vibrant red than the simpler red of Higoi.
Motoaka has red at the pectoral fin bases, while Motoguro has black.
Fukurin and net patterns describe similar scale traits but apply to varieties like Ogon and Asagi.
Doitsu Kujyaku are scaleless, unlike regular scaled Kujyaku.
Sumi refers to black in Koi, with the best being deep and pure.
Taisho Sanshoku grows Sumi spots over time, while Showa Sanshoku starts black, later showing white and red.
Ginrin scales shine gold on red and silver on white, appearing in any Koi variety.
Koromo has a white base with indigo Ai, while Goshiki has a colored base, often with red Hi.
Sumigoromo is a Koromo variant with black Sumi instead of indigo Ai.
Hachiware splits the Koi's face into two halves with its pattern.
Care and Maintenance
Three-year-old Kin Showa display mature beauty, making them an ideal age to buy.
Redder Hi is favored in Kin Showa and Kujyaku's red bloodline.
Ogon can grow over 32 inches in under 8 years with proper pond size and feeding.
High water quality and Koi health preserve pure white Shiroji.
Koi with Hi need Carotene-rich food like Spirulina to boost red markings.
Wild carp should not be added to Koi ponds due to their sensitivity stressing the group.
Ogon's lack of fear of humans makes the school friendlier when they're added.
Goshiki must keep growing to avoid turning black from dominant Hajiro traits.
Separate Bekko and Kohaku for shows since Kohaku's color food affects Bekko's Shiroji.
Shiro Utsuri and Kohaku need separate feeding strategies for competition.
Avoid rapid growth, environmental shifts, or illness to maintain Tancho's head Hi.
Falling water sounds stimulate Koi appetite, suggesting the addition of waterfalls.
Mineral-balanced water, like distilled with seawater, is optimal for Koi.
Montmorillonite Clay enhances water quality, mimicking Japanese mud ponds.
Koi can be fed until 10 PM as they forage at night.
Pond design should prioritize water quality for Koi health and growth.

Beauty and Appreciation
Symmetrical pectoral fins are vital for all Koi varieties' appeal.
Hi on Shusui's head, though optional, enhances its beauty.
Shusui's blue skin fades with age, making mature Koi with strong blue more desirable.
Shusui's Hi stabilizes after two years, unlike some shifting patterns.
Asagi's net pattern emerges at 4-5 years or 24 inches.
Bekko beauty is judged by Sumi size, position, number, and Shiroji purity.
Shiro Utsuri's appeal depends on Shiroji, Sumi quality, and pattern.
Tancho's resemblance to Japan's flag makes them highly prized there.
Perfect body conformation is the top factor in Koi beauty, with defects lowering value.
Ginrin's shiny scales can overshadow pattern quality at shows.
Shiroji and Hi are now equally valued, unlike past Hi preference.
Fukurin develops around 24 inches, enhancing Koi aesthetics.
Pure Shiroji in Kohaku highlights red Hi, crucial for their beauty.
Balanced patterns are essential for Koi beauty, learned through example study.
Ai in Aigoromo appears at varying ages like Tosai or 20-24 inches, depending on lineage.
Back scalation is key since Koi are viewed from above.
Growth and Longevity
Champion Koi require a reputable breeder, Nishikigoi knowledge, and honed raising skills.
Champions must exceed 40 inches with top quality and pattern.
Koi can live over 200 years with proper care, symbolizing longevity in Japan.
Some Koi reach 58 inches, far beyond typical sizes.
Females grow larger than males due to post-spawning appetite.
Breeders estimate Koi age via body shape, color, fins, scales, and Fukurin.
Ogon's Fukurin thickens beautifully past 24 inches.
Behavior and Biology
Koi rest on the pond bottom at night as sunlight fades.
Spawning occurs from March in沖縄 to May-June in Niigata, triggered by water temperature.
Koi lack stomachs, requiring small, frequent, digestible meals.
Over 120 Koi varieties exist, varying by classification.
Quarantine and Stress Recovery
New Koi need a 100-300 gallon quarantine tank for 21 days to prevent disease and recover from shipping.
Quarantine tanks should use pond or dechlorinated water at 72°F+ with 0.3% salt added beforehand.
Float the Koi bag for 20 minutes, mix in tank water, and skip food for 24 hours to ease transport stress.
For ponds unused by new Koi in over a year, quarantine new and one existing Koi at 0.5% salt for compatibility.
Watch for clamped fins or sluggishness in new Koi, adding 0.1-0.3% salt to aid immunity.
Introducing Koi to Your Pond or Aquarium
Float Koi bags in ponds for 20 minutes, add pond water slowly, then release to reduce stress.
Mix bag and aquarium water in a tub, adjust temperatures gradually, then transfer Koi gently.
Avoid wild carp in Koi ponds as their sensitivity disrupts balance and stresses Koi.
Daily Care and Maintenance
Feed digestible food like Manda Fu daily, only what Koi eat in 5-10 minutes every 3-4 hours, to avoid overfeeding.
Change 25% of unfiltered quarantine tank water every 2-3 days, adjust salt, and test ammonia/nitrate daily.
Use an air pump and monitor Koi near filters or surfaces for low oxygen needing quick fixes.
Healthy Koi swim actively and eat eagerly; isolate lethargic ones for observation.
Pond and Aquarium Environment
Build 10-30 ton ponds 1.5 meters deep with morning sun and shade for oxygen balance.
Use 90cm+ aquariums with efficient filters, 3-5cm pebbles, and water at 68-82.4°F (ideally 75.2-78.8°F).
Keep water at 68-82.4°F, targeting 75.2-78.8°F for Koi comfort.
Feeding and Seasonal Care
Feed Koi with red markings color-enhancing food for vivid hues.
After 65°F, use a 3:3:3 Hi-Silk mix (all-season, color-up) for summer growth and winter prep.
Koi sleep on pond bottoms at night and hibernate below 46.4°F, so avoid disturbance.
